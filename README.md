(Back-End)
## Problem Statement:
Our world is evolving in digital economy and individual investors as well as institutional investors yearn for reliable, easy and secure way of managing crypto and other asset portfolios. And there are many trading platforms in the market, but they have many disadvantages:
-	#### User Experience difficulty:
    Most of the modern trading platform are very complicated to learn. It takes a long period of time for new users to get themselves familiar with these platforms and understand how to use them. As a result, user interaction becomes relatively low, and a lot of people do not participate in trading.

-	#### Managing Assets and Orders:
    Most of the time, investors and traders are working in a way to manage many different assets. Without an organized approach to the placing, tracking, and fulfilling of orders particularly those involving multi-items-trading experiences would not be optimally effective.

-	#### Lack of Customizable Notifications:
    Real-time notifications on the fluctuation of asset prices, the status of order, and the history of trading are what provides user with better insights into decision making. Most of the platform have no personalization of notifications hence affect the investors.

-	#### No proper tract of portfolio:
    Many users need to know how assets performing over time or track specific assets in personalized watchlist. Available platforms have some limitations that would allow users to quickly react against market changes by making adequate portfolio adjustments.


### Objective:
The goal of this project is to provide an intuitive, secure and full-cycle Trading Platform that will be able to allow users to operate their digital assets in one place, manage trading history, create orders, and provide real-time notifications tailored to the userâ€™s preference.
